# Meow-Pet
This is a social platform for pet lovers and animal rescuer community. 

I have a goal to make this website become the largest social pet platform.

In early version, this website just have the post function with manual URL image input that can be used to posting your lost pets, such as cats, dogs, reptiles, birds, etc. You can give the information about your lost pet and user can comment on your post.

In the future, this website will have other functions. Just like Street Feeding Spot that based on Google Map API, Petshop and veterinarian locations, their contacts and you can call them directly. Overadopt program, to get the pet from other users, and you can use this feature to give your pet to other people, so you won't throw your pet away. I already planned other features for this website, but i can't tell you now. And this website absolutely will have mobile app for Android and iPhone.

if you want to test the demo website, you can visit this heroku link --> https://boiling-reaches-81712.herokuapp.com/

This website built with NodeJS, ExpressJS, Bootstrap 3 and MongoDB.

So far I'll included the following features:

- Fuzzy Search 
- Post, Petshops, Veteranirian, and Street Feeding location with Google Maps
- Display time since post was created
- User profile 
- Password reset 
- Image upload with multer and cloudinary 
- Migration to Bootstrap 4
- In-app notifications
